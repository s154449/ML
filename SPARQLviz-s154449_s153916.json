This is done by adding (or changing) the `file` URL parameter in the address bar so it looks like this:\n\n`https://madsholten.github.io/sparql-visualizer?file=<PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE>`\n\n`<PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE>` is the path to the JSON-file, and as it must be publicly available there are a few options. The easy one is to just add it to your private Dropbox and create a shared link to the file. When working in a Dropbox directory this is as easy as right-clicking the file and choosing `Copy Dropbox Link`. This will establish a direct link so changes in the file will be directly reflected in the visualizer when refreshing the browser view.\n\nAlternatively, the content of the JSON-file can be copied to a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Just provide a file name and create a secret or public gist. SPARQL-visualizer needs the raw file, so in the next window, click the *Raw* button. The URL of the raw page can be used as value for `<PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE>`."
